# Using Ultimate Duke Nukem 3D Custom

:warning: **Warning, you must own the original game!** :warning:

"Duke Nukem 3D" original or "Duke Nukem 3D: 20th Anniversary World Tour" on [steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/434050/Duke_Nukem_3D_20th_Anniversary_World_Tour/) to get the game file: **DUKE3D.GRP**

To use it, simply download the latest realase or [y0uls.com](https://y0uls.com) with the account "udnc/udnc" and install.\
**Run** the "**Ultimate Duke Nukem 3D Custom.exe**" after install and choose the launch options!

Have fun for many hours!

_It is possible to add your custom map for example by running "**Ultimate Duke Nukem 3D Custom.exe**", choose "**Maps**" from the drop-down list then click on "**Browse Folder**"._

_Once in the "maps" folder, create a folder with the name of the map and place the .map file there._

**!! Be careful in the "maps" section, the folders must contain only 1 .map file !!**\
**If there are several maps files, do the same manipulation but in the "mods" section**
